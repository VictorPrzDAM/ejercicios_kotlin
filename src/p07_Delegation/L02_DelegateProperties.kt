Kotlin provides a mechanism of delegated properties that allows delegating the calls of the property
set and get methods to a certain object. The delegate object in this case should have the method getValue.
For mutable properties, you'll also need setValue.

1 Delegates property p of type String to the instance of class Delegate.
  The delegate object is defined after the by keyword.
2 elegation methods. The signatures of these methods are always as shown in the example. Implementations
  may contain any steps you need. For immutable properties only getValue is required.
